Document Classification with CNN:
This GitHub repository showcases a document classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The aim of the project is to classify documents into different classes using the CNN model. The project is divided into different sections, each contributing to the overall implementation.

1. Libraries and Setup:
In this section, the required libraries are imported and the necessary packages are installed. These include packages like tensorflow, numpy, and others. The code also sets up the Google Drive connection for data storage and manipulation.

2. Text Data Preprocessing:
This section covers the data preprocessing steps, such as cleaning and preparing the text data. The code defines a preprocessing function that removes special characters, performs tokenization, and handles various text processing tasks. The dataset is loaded, processed, and saved as a DataFrame. Document lengths are analyzed, and the distribution of text lengths is visualized.

3. Model - CNN with Word Embedding:
This part focuses on implementing a CNN-based model with word embedding. It includes the following steps:

3.1. Data Setup
The data is split into training and testing sets. Tokenization and padding are applied to the text data. Labels are one-hot encoded.

3.2. Word Embedding
The GloVe pre-trained word vectors are used to create the word embedding layer. The model prepares the word embedding matrix for the embedding layer.

3.3. CNN Architecture
The CNN model architecture is constructed using Conv1D layers, MaxPooling1D layers, and other neural network components. This section includes the definition, compilation, and training of the CNN model.

3.4. Model Architecture Plot
The architecture of the CNN model is visualized and saved as an image.

3.5. Tensorboard Visualization
The model's performance is monitored and visualized using Tensorboard.

4. Model - CNN with Character Embedding:
This section focuses on implementing a CNN model with character embedding. It covers similar steps as the previous model, but this time, character-level tokenization and embedding are used.

Note:
This README provides a high-level overview of the project. To dive into the code details and explore the step-by-step implementation, refer to the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository. The project aims to showcase document classification using CNNs, highlighting different approaches with word and character embeddings. It's intended as a learning resource and can be extended or modified for specific needs.
